                <p>GoShipNow provides an online and mobile platform to connect Shippers with Carriers for the transportation of freight. Shippers can submit a request for the transportation of freight (“Shipment”), Truckers (truck driver or carrier) can accept such requests and assign drivers to fulfill them, and Shippers,  and Truckers can track such requests. This Privacy Policy describes how GoShipNow (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our websites, mobile applications, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us.
                  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you. </p>
